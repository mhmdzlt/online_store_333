# External Workspace Paths

These are the sibling workspaces used together for influencer/affiliate workflow:

- Store app: `C:\projects\online_store_3333\online_store_333`
- Admin app: `C:\projects\online_store_3333\admin\admin`
- Seller app: `C:\projects\online_store_3333\seller\seller`

## Notes

- Influencer approval + promo/referral generation is handled from the Admin app.
- Influencer applies and receives code/link inside the Store app.
- Seller app currently has no dedicated influencer referral UI flow.
